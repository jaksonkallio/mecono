# Mecono: Decenetralized Internet Access

## What is Mecono?

**Me**sh-**Co**nnected **No**des

Mecono is a hardware/protocol level project that enables P2P internet access using trustless discovery of how isolated nodes are connected and the indirect paths through the mesh between nodes.

Designed and developed by [Jakson Kallio](https://jaksonkallio.github.io).

## What makes Mecono awesome?
* Free communications.
* Largely eliminates the need for ISPs in most non-rural settings.
* Decentralized mesh of nodes; no regulation.
* Open source, free, and permissionless to set up and use.
* All communications are encrypted end-to-end by default.
* Permissionless server and file hosting.
* Resilient to large-scale crises via learning and redundant pathing.
* Very simple hardware required for easy and cheap connection setup in remote/undeveloped/volatile locations and environments.
* No more IP addresses, DNS servers, domain registration. Name lookup will be provided by a decentralized and trustless blockchain.
* Asynchronous and stateless connections offer communication over very long (possibly interplanetary) distances.
## What shortcomings does Mecono have?
* Large swathes of data about the network are difficult to sift through.
* New networks start slow and troubled while individual nodes learn optimizations.
* Sole developer doesn't have much hardware development knowledge.

## Use cases, small and large
* Easy-setup home networking.
* Easy-setup business/organization networking. Just one router for an entire business. Setup is so easy that no on-site networking specialists are required.
* Undeveloped countries and villages can set up network access easily with minimum hardware. Reduces risk and involvement of an ISP.
* ISPs can save money on infrastructure by connecting customers in a city to a single centralized ISP router.
* Mecono could replace the entire current internet protocol, and would receive all previously listed benefits.

## Project Status
Currently building the simulated environment, known as SimNetwork. This software is in extremely early development, and basic features (even simulations of basic features) are not yet implemented.
