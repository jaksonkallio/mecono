# Mecono: Decenetralized Internet Access

## What is Mecono?

**Me**sh-**Co**nnected **No**des

Mecono is a hardware/protocol level project that enables P2P internet access using trustless discovery of how isolated nodes are connected and the indirect paths through the mesh between nodes.

## What makes Mecono awesome?
* Free communications.
* Eliminates the need for ISPs, except in some conditions.
* Decentralized mesh of nodes; no regulation.
* Open source, free, and permissionless to set up and use.
* Encrypted communication is required by the protocol.
* Permissionless server and file hosting.
* Resilient to large-scale crises via learning and redundant pathing.
* Very simple hardware required for easy and cheap connection setup in remote/undeveloped/volatile locations and environments.
* Machine learning optimizes paths between nodes.
* No more IP addresses, DNS servers, domain registration.
* Asynchronous and non-"keep-alive" connections for data communication over very large (possibly interplanetary) distances.

## What shortcomings does Mecono have?
* Uncertain how machine learning handles incredibly large swathes of data about the rest of the network.
* New networks start slow and troubled while individual nodes learn optimizations.
* Sole developer doesn't have much hardware development knowledge.

## Project Status
Currently building the simulated environment, known as SimNetwork. This software is in extremely early development, and basic features (even simulations of basic features) are not yet implemented.

## Project Progress
Many of the planned features and details have not yet been implemented, so what is currently implemented is not the end result.
