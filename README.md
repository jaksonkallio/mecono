# Mecono: Decenetralized Internet Access

## What is Mecono?

**Me**sh-**Co**nnected **No**des

Mecono enables P2P internet access using trustless discovery of how isolated nodes are connected.

## Project Status
Currently building the simulated environment, known as SimNetwork. This software is in extremely early development, and basic features (even simulations of basic features) are not yet implemented.

## Build
Mecono uses CMake. In the root directory of Mecono folder:
```
mkdir -p ./src/build
cd ./src/build
cmake ..
make
```

Then run Mecono with `./mecono` while in the build directory.
